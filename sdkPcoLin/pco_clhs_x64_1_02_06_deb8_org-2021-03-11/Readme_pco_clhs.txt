README FOR SOFTWARE:  
pco_camera/pco_clhs

FOR PCO PRODUCT:
pco.edge_hs connected to CLHS grabber

DESCRIPTION:
This packages includes source files for a communication and grabber class for
pco.edge_clhs camera connected to a SiliconSoftware ME5 CLHS grabber.
The libpcoclhs must be linked to all programs, which use the pco classes. 
The sources for some simple example programs, which show the use of the class functions, are included.
All libraries and most of the example programs are available as static and dynamic version.


Attention:
To use the classes either the application 'pco_clhs_mgr' or the daemon 'pco_clhs_svc' must be started.
Both are supervising the clhs ports available on the installed grabber. If cameras are connected, the according links are established and
the camera is configured automaticly.
To close pco_clhs_mgr or pco_clhs_svc use the pkill command. For pco_clhs_mgr 'x' or ESC can also be used.
Ensure that all other applications, which use a clhs camera, are closed, before closing the manager application.
To show information about installed grabber and connected cameras pco_clhs_info application can be used.
The pco_clhs_info application could also be used to enable and disable distinct ports on the grabber.

CONTENTS:

Archive File Name: PCO_clhs_x64_1_02_xx.tar.gz

Installation Instructions:

Install driver and runtime from Silicon Software and check functionality of me5 board.
This PCO package does need the following packages from Silicon Software
runtime version:  siso-rt5-5.7.0.76321-linux-amd64
driver version:   menable_linuxdrv_src_4.2.6
applet version:   setup-mE5-MA-AF2-Applets-5.7.0-linux-amd64

The following applet must be flashed to the board
applet used:      libAcq_DualCLHSx1AreaRAW

Copy the pco_clhs_x64_1_02_xx.tar.gz to a distinct directory (e.g. PCO). 
Use "tar -xpvzf pco_clhs_1_02_xx.tar.gz" to get the sources.
After this you will find the following new directories and files as noted below.

Use "make" to compile all testprograms
Script symlink_pco creates the necessary links to the pco libraries in the bindyn directory.

If the programs can't find the siso libraries, you might have to add the following lines 
to /etc/environment (global) or /etc/bash.bashrc (shell only):

export SISODIR5="<path_to_siso_dir>"

export GENICAM_ROOT_V2_4=$SISODIR5/genicam
export GENICAM_CACHE_V2_4=$SISODIR5/genicam/cache
export GENICAM_LOG_CONFIG_V2_4=$SISODIR5/genicam/log/config/SisoLogging.properties

export PATH=$SISODIR5/bin/:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SISODIR5/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GENICAM_ROOT_V2_4/bin/Linux64_x64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

and replace the <path_to_siso_dir> with the appropriate path, usually ending with SiliconSoftware.

The environment setting must also be included in the run environment of QT-Creator, if a QT-Application is started out of the QT-Creator. 

To use the dynamic libraries script 'symlink_pco' can be used to create symbolic links to the 
pco libraries in pco_camera/pco_common/pco_libdyn. 
'symlink_pco -b' will create the links in directory ./bindyn
'symlink_pco -u' will create the links in directory /usr/local/lib (write permissions needed)
'symlink_pco "path"' will create the links in user selected directory "path"
To update the linker cache '/sbin/ldconfig' should be used afterwards
